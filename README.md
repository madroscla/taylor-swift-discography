# taylor_swift_discography
This repository contains a series of notebooks analyzing Taylor Swift's discography:

* **01_data_collection**: initial webscraping from [Genius](https://genius.com/) using [parsel](https://parsel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), creating a dataframe of Taylor Swift songs and lyrics.
* *TBD*

The [datasets folder](https://github.com/madroscla/taylor_swift_discography/tree/main/datasets) includes JSON, CSV, and pickle versions of the webscraping data.

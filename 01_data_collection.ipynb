    "# Taylor Swift Discography: Part I - Data Collection\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is the first in a series of notebooks analyzing Taylor Swift's discography; in this notebook, I collect and compile data using [parsel](https://parsel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to webscrape from [Genius](https://genius.com/), an online music encyclopedia. From there, I use pandas for dataframe creation and SQLite3 for database creation. \n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted that Genius does have an [API](https://docs.genius.com/) for application development. However, song lyrics are not made available via API, which is a crucial component of this project. A third-party Python package, [lyricsgenius](https://lyricsgenius.readthedocs.io/en/master/), is available to work in tandem with the API, webscraping on the user's behalf. I tested both the API and lyricsgenius as resources before ultimately concluding to collect the data myself.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting dataframes and database from this notebook are available in the [data folder](./data). CSV files used in this notebook are also included in the [data folder](./data/csv).\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook uses the modules [`genius_scrape.py`](./src/genius_scrape.py) for webscraping and discography dataframe creation and [`discog_mods.py`](./src/discog_mods.py) for additional modifications and transformations."

    "## Webscraping and Initial Dataframe\n",
    "\n",
    "Genius is very thorough in cataloguing an artist's discogrpahy, tracking all physical and digital variants of a release with different tracklists as well as singles, EPs, demo CDs, official playlists, and special releases. Therefore, Genius catalogues Taylor Swift as having over [100 different albums](https://genius.com/artists/Taylor-swift/albums), most of which contain repeated songs. For sake of processing times, I manually select the releases used to create the initial dataframe: this includes deluxe versions of original albums and \"Taylor's Version\" rerecordings of her studio albums are preferred, and non-album singles and streaming-specific EPs that contain previously unreleased tracks are included.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataframe is structured as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **album_title**: the title of the album (or other release) containing each song (string)\n",
    "* **album_url**: the URL to the Genius page for the album (string)\n",
    "* **category**: the categorical classification of an album/song (string)\n",
    "  * Note: In this project, the categories are studio album names, rerecording names, \"Non-Album Songs\" for songs made for soundtracks or Taylor Swift songs not associated with albums, and \"Other Artist Songs\" for collaborations ans remixes on other artists' albums. I'll often refer to these categories as \"eras,\" a terminology brought about via [The Eras Tour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eras_Tour).\n",
    "* **album_track_number**: the track number for the song on the given album (integer)\n",
    "* **song_title**: the title of the song (string)\n",
    "* **song_url**: the URL to the Genius page for the song (string)\n",
    "* **song_release_date**: the original release date for the song (date)\n",
    "* **song_page_views**: the amount of views the Genius song page has (integer)\n",
    "* **song_artists**: the performing artist(s) for the song (list)\n",
    "* **song_lyrics**: the lyrics to the song (string)\n",
    "* **song_writers**: the writer(s) for the song (list)\n",
    "* **song_producers**: the producers(s) for the song (list)\n",
    "* **song_tags**: the genre tag(s) for the song (list)"

    "## Data Cleaning and Additional Entries\n",
    "\n",
    "Like I said previously, many of Taylor Swift's releases contain repeating songs. For example, the streaming-specific EP, *The More Lover Chapter*, contains five songs: four songs are also on the standard release of the parent album, *Lover*, while only one song is a unique release. There are also numerous remixes and alternative versions of the same songs that are still the same lyrically. Both these remixes and repeated songs need to be removed from the dataframe; the latter can be easily filtered out while the former requires some manual work. Remixes or versions of songs that include new features, such \"Karma (Remix) (Ft. Ice Spice),\" are included for the sake of tracking collaborations, though they will be removed later in the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taylor also has several songs that she wrote for movies or cowrote/performed with other artists that ultimately don't end up one of her releases. Those albums weren't included in the initial data pull as to not require more cleanup after the fact. Those songs get added into the dataframe individually. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another small change I make is reverting instances of \"Joe Alwyn\" in both `song_writers` and `song_producers` to \"William Bowery,\" the original pseudonym used for these writing/producing credits. This is a personal preference, as I'd like the William Bowery song credits to be consistent across albums/eras."
